The **Boundless Curiosity Open Research Project** is an open, non-profit initiative dedicated to fostering amateur research across diverse disciplines including history, mathematics, computer science, economics, music, and more. Inspired by the spirit of intellectual exploration, it invites contributors from all walks of life to freely explore and share knowledge without institutional constraints.

## Who am I?

I’m a software developer who somehow became a living archive of tech history—a kind of ambulatory museum exhibit that occasionally mutters about monads and once knew how to make Turbo Pascal behave. Over four decades, I’ve ricocheted between building compilers for MS-DOS (yes, the 1980s one), designing object-oriented languages before Java had a fan club, and writing a couple of books on functional programming that remain niche classics in the “books engineers fall asleep to” category.

Somewhere along the way, I filed a patent for what we now call multi-factor authentication—though that was less visionary foresight and more a last-ditch attempt to make early-2000s wireless payments slightly less of a security punchline.

These days, I’m at Postman Labs, quietly poking at hard problems and resisting the urge to say “we tried that in 1994.” I also helped build a Linux mobile OS in 2007, which history has politely chosen not to remember.

My career has been less a master plan and more a series of “why not?” experiments that got out of hand—in the best possible way. If there’s a recurring theme, it’s that curiosity, pursued persistently enough, tends to leave a trail. 

## A Tribute to My Father: The Original Curious Mind

My father was the epitome of intellectual curiosity. He wasn’t just curious; he pursued his interests with an almost comical intensity. Imagine a man at the age of 60 deciding to master Russian literature—not by translations but by learning the language itself in a year and devouring all the Russian classics in their original form within the next two years. Or picture him solving obscure math problems while casually watching TV or launching into a detailed history of Yale University’s founding and its surprising connections to India.

He was a man who could have thrived as an Enlightenment-era amateur researcher, rubbing shoulders with the likes of Benjamin Franklin or Caroline Herschel in coffeehouses brimming with intellectual debates. His boundless curiosity and eccentric pursuits were not just hobbies—they were a way of life. And as fate would have it, these traits were passed down to me.

## My Journey: Carrying Forward the Tradition

Like my father, I am driven by an insatiable curiosity that spans diverse fields: 

- **History**: Exploring the roots of my mother tongue Malayalam and the socio-cultural heritage of Kerala.
- **Mathematics**: Delving into deep theoretical problems like P vs NP for decades.
- **Computational Complexity**: P vs NP, anyone?
- **Computational Theory**: Type theory, Category theory, Proof Theory
- **Computer Science history**: Investigating its history and pushing its boundaries through formal methods and generative AI.
- **Odds and Sods** : random topics in popular culture, light literature, cricket etc
- **macro-economics**:  Had I not been a software developer I would have been ana economist and probbaly rich!!
- **Music**: Transitioning from performance to theoretical explorations in music.

I am what one might call a "rabbit hole explorer," diving deep into topics that pique my interest without worrying about where they might lead. This lifelong pursuit has culminated in the creation of something I hold dear—the Boundless Curiosity Open Research Project.

 

 

### What You’ll Find

The repository includes:
- Explorations into history (e.g., Kerala’s cultural heritage).
- Mathematical musings (e.g., theoretical problems like P vs NP).
- Investigations into computer science principles.
- Theoretical insights into music.
- Macro-economic studies.

It’s a tribute to curiosity itself—a celebration of intellectual wanderlust inspired by my father’s legacy.
