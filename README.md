## Who am I?

I’m a software developer who accidentally became a walking archive of tech history, like a living museum exhibit that occasionally mutters about monads. Over four decades, I’ve ricocheted between building compilers for MS-DOS (yes, the *1980s* kind), architecting object-oriented languages before Java was cool, and somehow writing two books on functional programming that—while not exactly bestsellers—make excellent bedtime reading for insomniac engineers. I once filed a patent for what’s now called multi-factor authentication, though I’d love to claim it was visionary foresight rather than a desperate attempt to stop 2000s-era wireless payments from being comically insecure. These days, I’m at Postman Labs, quietly solving “hard problems” while pretending I didn’t help build a Linux mobile OS in 2007, a time that time forgot. My career is a testament to what happens when curiosity outpaces dignity—a series of “why not?” experiments that somehow stuck around[1][7][9].  

## A Tribute to My Father: The Original Curious Mind

My father was the epitome of intellectual curiosity. He wasn’t just curious; he pursued his interests with an almost comical intensity. Imagine a man at the age of 60 deciding to master Russian literature—not by translations but by learning the language itself in a year and devouring all the Russian classics in their original form within the next two years. Or picture him solving obscure math problems while casually watching TV or launching into a detailed history of Yale University’s founding and its surprising connections to India.

He was a man who could have thrived as an Enlightenment-era amateur researcher, rubbing shoulders with the likes of Benjamin Franklin or Caroline Herschel in coffeehouses brimming with intellectual debates. His boundless curiosity and eccentric pursuits were not just hobbies—they were a way of life. And as fate would have it, these traits were passed down to me.

## My Journey: Carrying Forward the Tradition

Like my father, I am driven by an insatiable curiosity that spans diverse fields: 

- **History**: Exploring the roots of my mother tongue Malayalam and the socio-cultural heritage of Kerala.
- **Mathematics**: Delving into deep theoretical problems like P vs NP for decades.
- **Computational Complexity**: P vs NP, anyone?
- **Computational Theory**: Type theory, Category theory, Proof Theory
- **Computer Science history**: Investigating its history and pushing its boundaries through formal methods and generative AI.
- **Odds and Sods** : random topics in popular culture, light literature, cricket etc
- **macro-economics**:  Had I not been a software developer I would have been ana economist and probbaly rich!!
- **Music**: Transitioning from performance to theoretical explorations in music.

I am what one might call a "rabbit hole explorer," diving deep into topics that pique my interest without worrying about where they might lead. This lifelong pursuit has culminated in the creation of something I hold dear—the Boundless Curiosity Open Research Project.

## Introducing the Boundless Curiosity Open Research Project

The Boundless Curiosity Open Research Project is a non-profit initiative hosted on GitHub. It’s an open repository dedicated to amateur research across diverse fields—history, science, mathematics, music, and more. All information is freely available under the Unlicense, ensuring that anyone can use it for any purpose.

At the moment, I am the only contributor. But anyone can create their branches and forks and do whatevs with it, till I  figure out how to make some method of organizng repos etc. Till then let the chaos of AI assisted neo-enlightenment age thrive!!!

### Why Amateur Research?

Amateur researchers have historically played pivotal roles in advancing human knowledge. From William Herschel discovering Uranus with his homemade telescope to Benjamin Franklin pioneering electricity studies while working as a printer, amateurs have often been the unsung heroes of scientific revolutions. During the Age of Enlightenment, coffeehouses became hubs for intellectual discourse where curious minds—scientists and amateurs alike—debated ideas that shaped modern science[^2][^6][^9].

With today’s powerful AI tools like Perplexity and Google Deep Research, we aim to revive this spirit of amateur inquiry. Our goal is to empower thinkers, dreamers, and researchers from all walks of life to contribute to knowledge without institutional constraints.

### What You’ll Find

The repository includes:
- Explorations into history (e.g., Kerala’s cultural heritage).
- Mathematical musings (e.g., theoretical problems like P vs NP).
- Investigations into computer science principles.
- Theoretical insights into music.
- Macro-economic studies.

It’s a tribute to curiosity itself—a celebration of intellectual wanderlust inspired by my father’s legacy.

## Join Us!

Whether you’re an amateur researcher or simply someone who loves exploring new ideas, we invite you to dive into our repository and contribute your own discoveries. Let’s rekindle the Enlightenment-era spirit of boundless curiosity together!
