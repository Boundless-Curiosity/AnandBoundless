## Important Note

This repository is a continuous work in progress. I'll be adding content incrementally as time permits.

### About the "Rabbit Hole" Section

You'll find my deeper research explorations in the subfolder called "Rabbit Hole." This section contains draft research documents that may include:

- Citation errors
- Broken links
- References to password-protected sites
- Occasional inaccuracies

Both AI and humans make mistakes in the pursuit of knowledge. I'm committed to reviewing and correcting these issues as I discover them, gradually refining the content through my ongoing curiosity and research efforts.

Thank you for your understanding and patience as this collection evolves.

# Directory Structure Documentation

This document explains the directory structure used in this project. The structure follows a hierarchical organization with topics, subtopics, and further subdivisions.

## General Structure

The directory is organized as follows:

```
&lt;topic&gt; (folder)
└── &lt;subtopic&gt; (folder)
    └── &lt;Rabbit Hole&gt; (folder)
        ├── file1
        └── file2
```

Each level is typically numbered to maintain a clear hierarchy and facilitate navigation.

## Example Structure

Below is an example of the actual directory structure:

```markdown
odds and sods/ (folder)
└── 4. PG Wodehouse/ (folder)
    ├── 4.1 Musical collaboration with Bolton/ (folder)
    │   └── 4.1.1 Rabbit Hole/ (folder)
    │       ├── 4.1.2 Citation errors remaining in revised draft.pdf
    │       └── 4.1.1 Baselined PGW Bolton Paper
    └── 4.2 Bloggy/ (folder)
        ├── 4.2.1 Linkedin article version- pgw-bolton
        └── 4.2.2 substack article version- pgw-bolton
```


## Navigation Guidelines

- Top-level folders represent main topics (e.g., "odds and sods")
- Second-level folders represent major categories within a topic (e.g., "4. PG Wodehouse")
- Third-level folders represent specific subtopics or projects (e.g., "4.1 Musical collaboration with Bolton")
- Fourth-level folders and beyond contain specific resources, documents, or further subdivisions


## Naming Conventions

Files and folders follow a numbering scheme that reflects their position in the hierarchy:

- Main topics may or may not have numbers
- Subtopics use the format: `[parent number].[current number] [description]`
- Files typically maintain the same numbering scheme as their parent folder

This structure allows for easy navigation and clear organization of related materials.
